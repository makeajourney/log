A\ncalling convention also specifies where the return value for a function\nis found.\n\nSome programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments\nare to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be\ntold at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a\ngiven function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a\nbridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.\n\nThe `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming\ninterface to various calling conventions.

A foreign function\ninterface is the popular name for the interface that allows code\nwritten in one language to call code written in another language.
